Having just conveniently Northcoders skills bootcamp for Data Engineering, and having gained a decent understanding of the Python programming language, I am currently deciding the best way to keep practising what I understand and how best to make use of my free time while applying for new jobs. Conveniently, it so happens to be the month of December, and a certain challenge I've seen before but never had the skills to participate in has come around once again.

In this repo you will find my attempts at all of the challenges in 2024's Advent of Code. Naturally, don't go looking if you don't want (rather unimpressive) spoilers. No idea how much of this I'll be capable of solving but I'll try every day and post my progress whether its successful or not.
